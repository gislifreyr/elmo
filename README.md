**elmo**
===================


### About

A repo of puppet recipes I use to setup my workstation. 'elmo.sh' takes care of setting up the proper repos, installing puppet and initiating the first puppet-run.
At the moment it has only been tested on Ubuntu.

The inspiration came from *tomas-edwardsson's* repo called *my-fedora-desktop* [right here on GitHub][1].


### Installation

Just clone the repo and run elmo.sh. The script needs the 'lsb_release' command to work.
